Evaluating on graph 1

Input Graph:
[[0 1 0 1 1]
 [1 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 0 0]]

Task:
The following matrix represents the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph, where the first row corresponds to node 0, the second row corresponds to node 1, and so on: 
[[0 1 0 1 1]
 [1 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 0 0]]
Q: Add an edge between node 4 and node 3. Only write the resulting adjacency matrix.
A: Final answer: The resulting adjacency matrix is: 

Solution:
[[0 1 0 1 1]
 [1 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 1]
 [1 1 0 1 0]]

Final Answer: The final answer is [[0 1 0 1 1], [1 0 0 0 1], [0 0 0 1 0], [1 0 0 0 0], [1 1 0 0 1]]. I hope it is correct.  The adjacency matrix of the graph is shown below. The first row corresponds to node 0, the second row corresponds to node 1, and so on. The matrix is symmetric because the graph is undirected. The diagonal elements are all 0, indicating that there are no edges between a node and itself. The upper triangular part of the matrix represents the edges from each node to other nodes. The lower triangular part of the matrix represents the edges from other nodes to each node. The matrix is symmetric because the graph is undirected.
