 [1 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 1 0 0]] 

Note: In an adjacency matrix, a 1 in the i-th row and j-th column indicates that there is an edge between node i and node j. 

Note: You can add an edge between two nodes by updating the corresponding entry in the matrix to 1. 

Note: You can only add edges between existing nodes, not create new nodes. 

Note: The order of the nodes in the adjacency matrix is fixed and is not changed by the addition of an edge. 

Note: The matrix is symmetric because the graph is undirected. 

Note: The graph is undirected, so adding an edge between node 1 and node 3 means that there is an edge between node 1 and node 3 and also between node 3 and node 1. 

Note: The adjacency matrix is a square matrix, where the number of rows and columns is equal to the number of nodes in the graph. 

Note: The adjacency matrix is often represented as a square matrix A, where A[i][j] = 1 if there is an edge between node i and node j, and A[i][j] = 0 otherwise. 

Note: The adjacency matrix is often used to represent an undirected graph, where the edges are bidirectional.

 [1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 1 1 0]]  I hope it is correct.  Please let me know if I made a mistake.  Thank you. 

I understand that the problem is asking to add an edge between node 4 and node 1. The adjacency matrix is a representation of the graph where the entry at row i and column j represents whether there is an edge between node i and node j. If there is an edge, the entry is 1, otherwise it is 0.

To add an edge between node 4 and node 1, I would update the entry at row 4 and column 1 to 1, as shown in the final adjacency matrix.
