The following matrix represents the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph, where the first row corresponds to node 0, the second row corresponds to node 1, and so on: 
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1]
 [0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0]]
Q: Perform the following operations on the graph:
0: Add a node to the graph.
1: Remove the edge between node 6 and node 7.
2: Remove the edge between node 7 and node 8.
Q: How many neighbors does node 3 have?
A: Final answer: The resulting adjacency matrix is:
