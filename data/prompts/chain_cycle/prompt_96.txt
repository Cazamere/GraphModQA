The following matrix represents the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph, where the first row corresponds to node 0, the second row corresponds to node 1, and so on: 
[[0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Q: Perform the following operations on the graph:
1: Remove node 10 from the graph.
2: Add an edge between node 7 and node 1.
3: Remove the edge between node 0 and node 1.
Q: Does this graph contain a cycle? Only write 'Yes' or 'No'.
A: Final answer: The final answer is:
