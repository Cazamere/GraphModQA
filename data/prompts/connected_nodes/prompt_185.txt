The following matrix represents the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph, where the first row corresponds to node 0, the second row corresponds to node 1, and so on: 
[[0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
 [1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1]
 [1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1]
 [1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1]
 [1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1]
 [1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1]
 [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1]
 [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0]]
