The following matrix represents the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph, where the first row corresponds to node 0, the second row corresponds to node 1, and so on: 
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
