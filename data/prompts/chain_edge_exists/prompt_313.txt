The following matrix represents the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph, where the first row corresponds to node 0, the second row corresponds to node 1, and so on: 
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

Q: Perform the following operations on the graph:
1: Add an edge between node 12 and node 4.
2: Remove the edge between node 4 and node 12.
3: Add an edge between node 14 and node 4.
Q: Is node 5 connected to node 1? Only write 'Yes' or 'No'.
A: Final answer: The final answer is:
