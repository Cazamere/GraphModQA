The explanation is as follows:
Node 4 corresponds to the 5th row and column in the original adjacency matrix. To remove node 4, we remove the 5th row and column from the original adjacency matrix. The resulting adjacency matrix has 7 rows and columns, and it represents the graph after removing node 4.

The given adjacency matrix represents an undirected graph with 8 nodes. To perform the operations, we'll modify the matrix accordingly.

1. Add a node to the graph:
We'll add a new row and column to the matrix to represent the new node. The resulting matrix will have 9 rows and columns. The new row and column will be filled with zeros, indicating no edges to or from the new node.

2. Add an edge between node 6 and node 5:
We'll add an edge between node 6 and node 5 by setting the corresponding entries in the matrix to 1. Since the graph is undirected, we'll set both `matrix[6][5]` and `matrix[5][6]` to 1.

Here's the resulting adjacency matrix:

[[0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

This is the resulting adjacency matrix after performing the operations.

Explanation: 
1. Adding a node to the graph means adding a new row and column to the adjacency matrix. The new row and column are all zeros since there are no edges to or from the new node.
2. Adding an edge between node 8 and node 1 means setting the entry at row 1, column 8 and row 8, column 1 to 1.

Explanation: 
1. Adding a node to the graph means adding a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, filled with zeros. This is because the new node has no edges to any other nodes initially.
2. Adding an edge between node 6 and node 4 means setting the (6,4) and (4,6) elements of the adjacency matrix to 1, since the graph is undirected.

Here's the step-by-step solution:
1. Add a node to the graph:
The resulting adjacency matrix will have an additional row and column for the new node. Initialize the new row and column with zeros, since the new node has no edges yet.

[[0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

Here is the step-by-step solution:
Step 1: Add a node to the graph. This means adding a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, filled with zeros. The new matrix will look like this:
[[0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0]

 [0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Step 2: Remove node 3 from the graph. This means removing the 4th row and column from the adjacency matrix. The new matrix will look like this:
[[0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0]

 [0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

The final resulting adjacency matrix is:

Here's the step-by-step process to get the final adjacency matrix:
1. Add a node to the graph: Add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, filled with zeros, except for the diagonal element which is 0. The resulting matrix has a size of 11x11.
2. Add a node to the graph: Add another new row and column to the adjacency matrix, filled with zeros, except for the diagonal element which is 0. The resulting matrix has a size of 12x12.
3. Add an edge between node 3 and node 8: Set the element at the 4th row and 9th column to 1, and set the element at the 9th row and 4th column to 1, since the graph is undirected.

The adjacency matrix remains the same because there was already an edge between node 2 and node 6.

2. Remove the edge between node 2 and node 3:
The adjacency matrix changes to:

Here's the step-by-step process to obtain the final adjacency matrix:

1. Add an edge between node 0 and node 1:
The adjacency matrix remains the same since there is already an edge between node 0 and node 1.

2. Add a node to the graph:
Add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, filled with zeros, to represent the new node. The resulting matrix is:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

3. Remove the edge between node 0 and node 1:
Set the entries at row 0, column 1 and row 1, column 0 to 0. The resulting matrix is:
[[0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]

Explanation: When we add a node to the graph, we add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, filled with zeros, to represent the new node's connections. Since the new nodes have no connections to the existing nodes, the new rows and columns are all zeros. We perform this operation twice, resulting in the final adjacency matrix with two additional rows and columns.

The operations are performed in the following order:
1. Add a node to the graph: The new node is added as node 10, and the adjacency matrix is extended with an additional row and column of zeros.
2. Remove node 5 from the graph: The fifth row and column are removed from the adjacency matrix.
3. Remove node 7 from the graph: The seventh row and column are removed from the adjacency matrix.
The resulting adjacency matrix is:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the final answer:

1. Remove the edge between node 2 and node 4:
The original adjacency matrix is:
[[0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Remove the edge between node 2 and node 4 by setting the corresponding entry to 0:
[[0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]

2. Add an edge between node 0 and node 3:
Add the edge by setting the corresponding entries to 1:
[[0 0 0 1 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]

3. Add a node to the graph:
Add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix to represent the new node. Initialize all entries in the new row and column to 0, except for the diagonal entry which is 0:
[[0 0 0 1 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]

The resulting adjacency matrix is:
[[0 0 0 1 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]

 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 1 0 0 0]]
Here's how I got it:
Step 1: Add a node to the graph. This will add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, filled with zeros. The new matrix is:
[[0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Step 2: Remove node 0 from the graph. This means removing the first row and column from the adjacency matrix. The resulting matrix is:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 1 0 0 0]]
This is the final resulting adjacency matrix.

Explanation: 
To add a node to the graph, we add an extra column and row to the adjacency matrix. This new row and column represent the new node. 

To add an edge between node 2 and node 0, we set the value at the intersection of row 2 and column 0 to 1, and the value at the intersection of row 0 and column 2 to 1, since the graph is undirected.

 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Explanation:
1. Remove the edge between node 1 and node 3: This means we need to set the entry at row 1, column 3 and row 3, column 1 to 0. The resulting matrix is:
[[0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]

2. Add a node to the graph: This means we need to add a new row and column to the matrix, representing the new node. Since the new node has no edges to any other nodes, the new row and column will be all zeros, except for the diagonal entry which is 0. The resulting matrix is:

Operation 2: Add an edge between node 4 and node 3.
This means we need to add 1 at position [4,3] and [3,4] in the adjacency matrix.
After performing these operations, we get the resulting adjacency matrix as shown above.

The explanation is as follows:
1. To add an edge between node 3 and node 9, we set the corresponding entries in the adjacency matrix to 1. However, since we will remove node 9 later, this operation does not affect the final result.
2. To remove node 9 from the graph, we simply remove the last row and column from the adjacency matrix, since node 9 corresponds to the last row and column. The resulting adjacency matrix has a size of 9x9.

Explanation: 
1. Adding a node to the graph means adding a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, with all elements being 0, except for the diagonal element which is also 0 (since there are no edges from a node to itself). 
2. Adding an edge between node 1 and node 4 means setting the element at row 1, column 4 to 1, and the element at row 4, column 1 to 1 (since the graph is undirected).

The explanation is as follows:
Operation 1: Add an edge between node 7 and node 0.
The adjacency matrix becomes: 
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0]

[[0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]

 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
The explanation is as follows:
1: Add an edge between node 0 and node 1: 
The adjacency matrix initially had a 0 at the (0,1) and (1,0) positions, indicating no edge between node 0 and node 1. To add an edge, we set these positions to 1. 
2: Add a node to the graph:
We add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix to represent the new node. We initialize all the values in this new row and column to 0, indicating no edges to or from this new node. The resulting adjacency matrix has 8 rows and columns, representing 8 nodes in the graph.

 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]

2. Add an edge between node 1 and node 2. This results in the following adjacency matrix:

 [0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]

3. Remove the edge between node 1 and node 2. This results in the following adjacency matrix:

 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Explanation: 
Operation 1: Add a node to the graph. 
The new node is node 9. The adjacency matrix becomes: 
[[0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]

 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Operation 2: Add a node to the graph. 
The new node is node 10. The adjacency matrix becomes: 
[[0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]

 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Operation 3: Remove node 2 from the graph. 
The adjacency matrix remains the same because node 2 was not connected to any other node. 
Therefore, the resulting adjacency matrix is: 
[[0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]

Explanation: 
1. Add an edge between node 6 and node 0: 
   Set matrix[6][0] = 1 and matrix[0][6] = 1 since it is an undirected graph.

2. Add an edge between node 8 and node 2: 
   Set matrix[8][2] = 1 and matrix[2][8] = 1 since it is an undirected graph.

3. Remove the edge between node 4 and node 9: 
   Set matrix[4][9] = 0 and matrix[9][4] = 0 since it is an undirected graph. However, this edge already doesn't exist, so this operation doesn't change anything.

Explanation: 
We are asked to perform two operations on the graph:
1. Add a node to the graph: This means we will add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, with all elements being 0, since the new node is not connected to any other node.
2. Remove node 9 from the graph: This means we will remove the 9th row and column from the adjacency matrix.

So, first, we add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, resulting in a 11x11 matrix. Then, we remove the 9th row and column, resulting in a 10x10 matrix. The final adjacency matrix is shown above.

The first operation is to add a node to the graph. This results in an additional row and column in the adjacency matrix, with all elements being 0, since the new node has no connections. 

The resulting adjacency matrix is:
[[0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]

The second operation is to remove node 2 from the graph. This means removing the third row and column from the adjacency matrix. 

The resulting adjacency matrix is:

 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Explanation: 
To remove node 1 from the graph, we simply remove the second row and the second column from the adjacency matrix. This results in the following matrix: 
[[0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 1 0 1 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]]
To add a new node to the graph, we add a new row and a new column to the adjacency matrix. The new node is not connected to any other nodes, so the new row and column are filled with zeros, except for the diagonal element which is zero. This results in the following matrix: 
[[0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 1 0 1 0 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
The resulting adjacency matrix is the same as the original matrix with the second row and column removed, and a new row and column added.

The second operation is to remove the edge between node 2 and node 4. This means we set the entry at row 2, column 4 and row 4, column 2 to 0. The resulting matrix is:

 [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]]
Explanation: 
To add a node to the graph, we add a new row and column to the adjacency matrix, with all entries being 0 except for the diagonal entry, which is 0.

To remove node 4 from the graph, we remove the 5th row and column from the adjacency matrix. The resulting adjacency matrix is a 10x10 matrix, where the last row and column correspond to the new node.
